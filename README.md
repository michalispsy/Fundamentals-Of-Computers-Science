minimum_r_with_dijsktra's_algorithm.py :
A program that finds the minimum r, for which an r-restricted path between two nodes exists. Computation works with Dijsktra's algorithm

minimum_r_with_binary_search.py :
A program that finds the minimum r, for which an r-restricted path between two nodes exists. Computation works with Binary search algorithm

find_r_restricte_path.py :
A proggram that finds if an r-restricted path exists between two nodes using the DFS algorithm

find_maximum_e.py :
A proggram that finds the maximum edge value of every trip between any two nodes of a tree

fuelstops.py :
Program that finds the path with the fewer stops for refueling using Dijkstra's algorithm
